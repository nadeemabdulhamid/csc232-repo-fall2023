# SP 7

Choose at least one of these and solve it ***entirely on your own*** to count as a "Solved Problem". Copy/paste your solution, or upload your python file, to the assignment submission on Canvas. At the top of your program/file, put a comment with your name, and the URL of the problem that it solves.

If you start on one of these and get stuck, you can ask me for help on Discord or email. I'll either give you a small hint and you can continue solving it on your own and submit it, or if I need to give you more help to figure out a technique to solve it, then I'll suggest you try another one on your own.
