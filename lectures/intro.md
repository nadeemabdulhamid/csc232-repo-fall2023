# What is Competitive Programming?

Given a concrete problem statement:

- analyze the problem and determining what algorithm can solve it
- identify possible pitfalls and corner cases
- quickly produce an implementation that passes test cases


    > sport of the mind

# Benefits

- Improved problem solving skills
- Improved practical knowledge of algorithms
|
- Write more optimized code
- Write less buggy code
|
- Great practice for technical interviews
- Have fun, win prizes and glory

# Competitions vs. Industry

- Severe time pressure
    - no time for unit tests
    - no time to write documentation
- Style and code quality doesn’t matter*
- Maintainability doesn’t matter
- Problems self-contained
